Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript


Object in javascript uses Key value pairs.
for examplee A bag contains books and box and water bottle 
in this exapmle bag is a container that stores books inside it so bag is considerred as a objects

var bag={
    books: "5";
    waterbottle:"1"
}

in object we can also use functions and methods as a value;
using  Inheritance
example:
var vehicle = {
    start: function() {
        console.log('The vehicle engine is started.');
    }
};



var bike = Object.create(vehicle);
bike.type = 'Mountain';
bike.start();
