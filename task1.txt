 Difference between HTTP 1.1 vs HTTP 2

 In HTTP 1.1  i works in one request in single connection 
 multiple request at the same time is not possible.

 In HTTP 2 we can send and recieve multiple request and response at the same time in single connection.
multiplexing is a feature  that improves the page loading and the performance of the websites


In HTTP 1.1 had an issue with the header in plain text formates  which is updated in HTTP2
with header compression reducing the size of the header transmitted between client and server 
the optimization eis network utilization ,faster page rendering,reduced bandwidth and data transfer.


HTTP 1.1 uses Text protocol which makes it human readable makes it less efficient in parsing whereas in HTTP 2
which is more compact and easier for machines to interpret also reduces parsing complexities .

HTTP 1.1 , clients are required to explicitly request each resource needed to render a webpage, 
resulting in additional round trips and potential delays.in HTTP2 server can push resources proactively.


HTTP 1.1  does not allow Stearm prioritization  HTTP2 allows priotization of resources
